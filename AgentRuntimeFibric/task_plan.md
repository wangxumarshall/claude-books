# AgentRuntimeFabric Documentation Plan

## Goal

Deeply understand all files in this directory and produce an actionable AgentRuntimeFabric architecture, implementation, and requirement-realization document that can guide continued open-source development and Codex implementation.

## Phases

| Phase | Status | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Inventory | complete | Identify all files, roles, and existing themes. |
| 2. Evidence Extraction | complete | Extract concepts, requirements, modules, objects, states, protocols, and gaps from every source file. |
| 3. Synthesis | complete | Distill a coherent architecture and implementation plan, separating validated facts from proposed structure. |
| 4. Draft Document | complete | Write the design document with phases, boundaries, contracts, state machines, error handling, observability, examples, and anti-examples. |
| 5. Verification | complete | Check the document against the user's requirements and repository evidence. |
| 6. Open-source stacking route | complete | Add guidance for building on and refactoring existing open-source projects without leaking their internal models into AgentRuntimeFabric core interfaces. |
| 7. Differentiation Rebuild | complete | Re-read the two architecture implementation documents, research mainstream/frontier industry approaches, identify gaps where ARF currently lacks a defensible advantage, and build explicit differentiated capabilities back into both documents. |

## Deliverables

- New architecture/design document in the project directory.
- Planning notes in `findings.md` and `progress.md`.

## Constraints

- Cover every current source file in the directory.
- Prefer evidence from existing documents over invention.
- Mark proposals as proposals when they go beyond existing text.
- Keep requirements decomposable, constrained, verifiable, and reusable.
- Support implementation through incremental stacking and refactoring of existing open-source projects.
- New request on 2026-05-07: do not assume ARF already has differentiation; compare against industry mainstream/frontier systems and construct a defensible differentiation story plus implementable architecture capabilities.
